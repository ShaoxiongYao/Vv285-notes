# Vv285-notes

This repository holds personal notes of [Vv285](https://umji.sjtu.edu.cn/~horst/teaching/vv285.html) taught by Prof. Horst Hohberger in summer 2018 at UM-SJTU Joint Institute. 
The [original slides](vv285_main_summer2018.pdf) of the course are also in this repository.

### Motivation 
I reviewed the linear algebra part preparing to be a teaching assistant of Vv214 in spring 2019.
I reorganized some proofs and introduction of concepts in linear algebra.
I reviewed the part on multivariate calculus for fun, and that part was mostly retyping the original slides.

### Timeline
+ linear algebra: winter break of 2018-2019,
+ multivariate calculus: spring break of 2020.
